### About Me

I began my higer educational journey at Southern Methodist University before transferring to the University of Texas my sophomore year. In Austin, I have pursued a degree in computational biology while completing pre-med courses.

While at UT, I was chosen to work under a biostatistics professor, <a href="mailto:nathaniel.raley@utexas.edu">Dr. Nathaniel Woodward</a>, for the Department of Statistics as a teaching assistant. As a teaching assistant, I was able to strengthen my basic skills in R studio as I concurrently helped students through their biostatistics class. The rest of the my resume highlights my work experience, strengths, and accomplishments.

I can be contacted by <a href="mailto:tdd683@utexas.edu">email</a>.
