This post shows how the package *reticulate* can be utilized in an R Markdown to converse to python. This example uses matrices and their properties to explore differnt characteristics of python.

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
```

First, a randamized matrix is made in a r code block.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
matrix <- matrix(round(13 * rexp(200)), 10)
```

This matrix variable can be called in a python code block and converted to an array. Numpy can also imported so it's functions can be used on the array.

```{python}
import numpy as np
array = r.matrix
print(array)
```

```{python}
mean = np.mean(array)
print("Using numpy, it is found that the mean of the array is %.2f." % mean)
```


```{python}
std = np.std(array)
print("The standard deviation is determined to be %.2f" % std)
```

```{r}
median(py$array)
```

The python variable *array* can be called in the r code block to determine that the median is 10.

Arrays are considered to be 2-D lists in python. Lists have a unique feature, called **indexing**, which allows elements in the list to be accessed. When indexing, the first element is considered "0", the second "1", and so on like as follows:

List slicing uses indexing to access multiple elements in the list. For a list being cut using the code *my_list[4:7]*, the following occurs:

Therefore, the array's elemets can be accessed using indexing and slicing.

```{python}
array[5][3:9]
```

By using the index operations above on the array, the 6th row from the array is retrieved. Within that row, the 4th through 9th element are then returned.

```{python}
array[8].sum()
```

The sum of the 9th row is 233.0.

The array can be converted into a string to utilize the *re* module.

```{python}
import re

str_array = []
for row in array:
  for element in row:
    str_array.append(str(element))
    
string1 = " ".join(str_array)

two_digit = re.findall(r"\d\d\.\d", string1)
```

Using the function re.findall(), all two-digit numbers can be found.

```{python}
nums = []
for element in two_digit:
  nums.append(int(element[0:2]))
  
sum(nums)
```

The sum of all two digit numbers in the array is 2201.
